## characters

*Characters* include yourself and all of the individuals you'll interacting with on your adventure - be they friend or foe.

Characters can be split into two broad categories: *Player Characters* (abbreviated *PCs*), who are played by others, and *Non-Player Characters* (abbreviated *NPCs*), who are not.

To start your journey, you will first need to create a character.

### character progression

Characters grow by gaining *Experience*. When they have gained the requisite amount of *Experience Points* (abbreviated *EXP*), they will level up.

A character's *Level* is a measure of their progression in the game. A character becomes stronger by gaining more and more levels. Areas of the world will become more accessible to characters as their level increases.

### character attributes

Before we get too far, let's first talk about one of most the essential building blocks of characters: *Attributes*. Attributes control most of the game's mechanics.

There are the following attributes:
  - [Strength](#strength)
  - [Intelligence](#intelligence)
  - [Dexterity](#dexterity)
  - [Endurance](#endurance)
  - [Willpower](#willpower)
  - [Luck](#luck)

Every character will start with 5 points allocated in each attribute and will receive 6 points to allocate into the attributes of their choosing. Every time a character levels up, they will receive an additional 6 attribute points to allocate. The more points that are allocated into an attribute, the stronger its effect.

#### strength

*Strength* (abbreviated *STR*) heavily influences physical damage and slightly influences accuracy, physical defense, and health. It is a requirement for equipping physical weapons and armor.

#### intelligence

*Intelligence* (abbreviated *INT*) heavily influences magical damage and slightly influences accuracy and magical defense. It is a requirement for equipping magical weapons and armor.

#### dexterity

*Dexterity* (abbreviated *DEX*) heavily influences ranged weapon damage, influences accuracy and attack speed, and slightly influences evasion. It is a requirement for equipping weapons and armor.

#### endurance

*Endurance* (abbreviated *END*) heavily influences physical defense and influences health. It is a requirement for equipping physical armor.

#### willpower

*Willpower* (abbreviated *WILL*) heavily influences magical defense and slightly influences health. It is a requirement for equipping magical weapons and armor.

#### luck

*Luck* (abbreviated *LUCK*) heavily influences evasion and influences accuracy and critical hit chance.

### character races

Denth's inhabitants consist of a variety of *Races*.

There are the following playable races:
  - [Dwarves](#dwarves)
  - [Elves](#elves)
  - [Humans](#humans)
  - [Orcs](#orcs)

A character receives intrinsic modifiers to their attributes based on their race. The effect of these modifiers increases as the character levels up.

#### dwarves

Dwarves are a stout, industrious race. They are fond of mountains and build vast, subterranean cities within them. They are very adept craftsmen and are renowned as the best blacksmiths in all of Denth.

Dwarves are indifferent to the affairs of other races, and their relationships with others are largely based on commerce. They have long histories with Elves and interact most closely with Humans, their largest trade partners.

The average male Dwarf stands 4'4" (132.1 cm) tall and weighs 135 lbs (61.2 kg). The average female Dwarf stands 4'1" (124.5 cm) tall and weighs 110 lbs (49.9 kg). They have long lifespans, living upwards of 300 years.

Dwarves have great physical strength, a good constitution, and especially favorable luck. They generally prefer physical combat over magic, can be particularly stealthy, and have a penchant for games of chance. Earthen creatures, like Golems, have an affinity towards Dwarves, making them easier for Dwarves to control and train as companions.

The attribute modifiers per level for Dwarves are listed below:

| STR | INT | DEX | END | WILL | LUCK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| +2  |     | +1  | +1  |      | +2   |

#### elves

*Elves* are a reclusive race. They inhabit the forested regions of Denth and rarely venture away from the comfort of nature. They focus on meditation, deep study, and other mental pursuits, taking on pupils from other races on rare occasions and offering advice and consultation in times of great strife.

Elves are deeply respected by nearly all races. They rarely involve themselves in the events of the world; however, they are almost always present during great turning points in history. They are guardians of dark, forgotten relics and knowledge sealed away by the ancients, safeguarding the world from their dangers.

The average male Elf stands 6'1" (185.4 cm) tall and weighs 160 lbs (72.6 kg). The average female Elf stands 5'9" (175.3 cm) tall and weight 145 lbs (65.8 kg). Elves are among the longest living creatures, with lifespans exceeding 1,000 years.

Elves possess uncanny agility, extensive wisdom, and an acute mind, but at the cost of physical might and durability. They have an innate connection with the world's flora, making it easier for them to control sentient plant life as companions.

The attribute modifiers per level for Elves are listed below:

| STR | INT | DEX | END | WILL | LUCK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
|     | +2  | +3  |     | +1   |      |

#### humans

*Humans* are a diverse race. They can be found in many different climates and regions of Denth, and they have the largest population of any race. They take up a wide range of professions and are especially adept at farming.

Relations between Humans and other races is generally peaceful, and they are often called upon to mediate disputes between other races.

The average male Human stands 5'7" (170.2 cm) tall and weighs 160 lbs (72.6 kg). The average female Human stands 5'3" (160.0 cm) tall and weighs 120 lbs (54.4 kg). Humans live relatively short lives, with average lifespans of between 70 and 80 years.

Humans are well-balanced, with no notable area of strength or weakness. They are proficient in many forms of physical combat and magic, but less specialized than other races.

The attribute modifiers per level for Humans are listed below:

| STR | INT | DEX | END | WILL | LUCK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| +1  | +1  | +1  | +1  | +1   | +1   |

#### orcs

*Orcs* are an aggressive, tribal race. They prefer to inhabit the plains of Denth where they organize themselves into close-knit groups led by a Chieftain. Orcs rarely take up craft professions with the exception of smithing and prefer basic professions like hunting or fishing.

Orcs are very territorial, often contesting land between tribes and other races. Relations between Orcs and other races is sometimes hostile, and Orc tribes are rarely trusting of outsiders.

The average male Orc stands 6'6" (198.1 cm) tall and weighs 215 lbs (97.5 kg). The average female Orc stands 6'2" (188.0 cm) tall and weighs 180 lbs (81.6 kg). Orcs are generally short-lived, usually dying in battle or some form of conflict before reaching the age of 40 or 50, but they can live up to 70 years.

Orcs are brutish, hulking creatures, possessing raw strength and constitution. They specialize almost exclusively in physical combat and heavy weaponry, lacking proficiency with and resistance to magic. Orcs have a strong affinity with beasts, making them easier for Orcs to tame and train as companions.

The attribute modifiers per level for Orcs are listed below:

| STR | INT | DEX | END | WILL | LUCK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| +3  |     | +1  | +2  |      |      |

### character specializations

There are the following specializations:
  - [Archers](#archers)
  - [Magicians](#magicians)
  - [Rogues](#rogues)
  - [Warriors](#warriors)

A character receives modifiers to their attributes as they gain proficiency in their respective specialization. The effect of these modifiers increases as the character levels up.

#### archers

*Archers* specialize in ranged combat. They prefer to wield bows or crossbows and wear medium or light armor. They are surprisingly evasive and accurate and have a high damage output potential.

The attribute modifiers per level for archers are listed below:

| STR | INT | DEX | END | WILL | LUCK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| +1  |     | +3  |     |      | +2   |

#### magicians

The attribute modifiers per level for magicians are listed below:

| STR | INT | DEX | END | WILL | LUCK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
|     | +3  |     |     | +3   |      |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| +3  |     | +1  | +2  |      |      |

## equipment

Characters adorn themselves with equipment in order to improve their offensive and defensive capabilities.

### equipment grades

Equipment can have varying *Grades* corresponding to their quality and effectiveness.

There are the following equipment grades:
  - Legendary (highest grade)
  - Mythic
  - Epic
  - Flawless
  - Exquisite
  - Common
  - Inferior
  - Flawed
  - Broken (lowest grade)

The grade of equipment can be improved by a blacksmith, provided they have the necessary skill and materials. There is greater risk of failure associated with higher grade improvements, but the higher the blacksmith's skill level and luck, the lower this risk becomes. Should the attempt to improve the grade fail, the equipment's grade will be reduced to broken.

### equipment materials

Equipment can be created from a wide variety of *Materials*, the strength of which influences the strength of the equipment.

There are the following types of equipment materials:
  - *Metal*
    - Carbon
    - Tempered Steel
    - Titanium
    - Steel
    - Iron
    - Bronze
  - *Precious Metal*
    - Gold
    - Silver
    - Copper
  - *Gemstones*
    - Diamond
    - Ruby
    - Sapphire
    - Emerald
    - Pearl
    - Topaz
    - Quartz
  - *Wood*
    - Bamboo
    - Yew
    - Elm
    - Oak
    - Maple
    - Hickory
    - Ash
  - *Hide*
    - Elkskin
    - Boarskin
    - Deerskin
    - Goatskin
    - Pigskin
    - Cowhide
  - *Cloth*
    - Silk
    - Linen
    - Fur
    - Wool

### equipment condition

The *Condition* of equipment declines as it is used and may be restored by repairing it. Condition is represented as a percentage from 100% (best condition) to 0% (worst condition). If the equipment's condition falls to 0%, then its grade will be reduced to the lowest grade, broken.

### equipment enchantments

Equipment can be imbued with magical enhancements, called *Enchantments*. Enchantments are learned by dismantling magical equipment and by gaining experience at enchanting. Characters must have significant magical ability in order to place enchantments on equipment. Equipment may possess only one enchantment, and it may be disenchanted by a skilled enchanter without dismantling it.

### equipment augments

*Augments* are magical stones that can be inserted into equipment. Augments are created by infusing a gemstone with an *Augmentation*. Augmentations are more basic and less powerful than enchantments, but they have a practical advantage: their reusability and portability. An augment can be easily inserted into and removed from equipment or traded with others. You can also add multiple augments to a single piece of equipment.

In order to insert an augment into a piece of equipment, the equipment must have an open slot. Slots can be added to equipment by a skilled blacksmith, and most equipment can be slotted multiple times.

### equipment types

There are several different *Types* of equipment, restricting where the equipment may be worn or wielded and the offensive or defense capabilities that they offer.

There are the following types of equipment:
  - [Weapons](#weapons)
  - [Armor](#armor)
  - [Accessories](#accessories)

#### weapons

Weapons improve a character's offensive capabilities.

Weapons have a *Handedness*: either *One-handed* or *Two-handed*. Two-handed weapons are heavier, slower, and more difficult to wield than one-handed weapons, but they provide higher damage output and more blocking potential. One-handed weapons have a practical advantage over two-handed weapons: they only occupy one hand, allowing characters to equip something else in their other hand.

There are the following types of weapons:
  - *One-handed*:
    - Cleaver
    - Dagger
    - Wand
    - Whip
  - *Two-handed*:
    - Bow
    - Crossbow
    - Glaive
    - Halberd
    - Scythe
    - Spear
    - Staff
  - *One-handed* and *Two-handed*:
    - Axe
    - Club
    - Flail
    - Mace
    - Sword

Characters gain proficiency with a weapon type the longer they wield weapons of that type. The more proficient a character is with a weapon type, the more effective those weapons will be in combat and the slower their condition will degrade with use.

#### armor

Armor improves a character's defensive capabilities.

Armor is categorized according to three weights: *Heavy*, *Medium*, and *Light*. Generally, heavier armor grants greater protection, while lighter armor offers better mobility. Heavy armor are usually only practical for characters with exceptional constitution engaging in extreme combat.

Armor is worn at (or near) one of the following locations on the body: the *Head*, *Chest*, *Legs*, *Hands*, or *Feet*. Generally, armor worn on the chest and legs provides the most protection, followed by armor worn on the head, followed by armor worn on the hands and feet.

There are the following types of armor:
  - Plate (heavy)
    - Head: *Plate Helmet*
    - Chest: *Plate Cuirass*
    - Legs: *Plate Greaves*
    - Hands: *Plate Gauntlets*
    - Feet: *Plate Boots*
  - Scalemail (heavy)
    - Head: *Scalemail Coif*
    - Chest: *Scalemail Hauberk*
    - Legs: *Scalemail Leggings*
  - Chainmail (medium)
    - Head: *Chainmail Coif*
    - Chest: *Chainmail Hauberk*
    - Legs: *Chainmail Leggings*
  - Hide (medium)
    - Head: *Helmet*, *Hat*, *Cowl*
    - Chest: *Cuirass*, *Vest*
    - Legs: *Leggings*
    - Hands: *Bracers*, *Gloves*
    - Feet: *Boots*, *Shoes*
  - Cloth (light)
    - Head: *Hat*, *Cowl*
    - Chest: *Tunic*, *Robe*
    - Legs: *Trousers*
    - Hands: *Gloves*
    - Feet: *Shoes*

Characters gain proficiency with an armor type the longer they wear armor of that type. The more proficient a character is with an armor type, the more effective that armor will be in combat and the slower its condition will degrade with use.

#### accessories

Accessories can enhance either the offensive or defensive capabilities of the character and/or provide additional benefits beyond just combat. Accessories are the easiest equipment to enchant and augment.

Accessories are worn at one of the following locations on the body: the *Right Ear*, *Left Ear*, *Neck*, *Waist*, *Right Wrist*, *Left Wrist*, *Right Ring Finger*, or *Left Ring Finger*.

There are the following types of accessories:
  - Ears: *Studs*, *Hoops*, *Spikes*
  - Neck: *Necklace*, *Choker*
  - Waist: *Belt*, *Sash*
  - Wrists: *Bracelet*, *Circlet*, *Wristband*
